Here are some of my current projects:
- [Create Incremental](https://banacubed.github.io/Create-Incremental)

I mostly do development of incremental games using [TMT](https://github.com/Acamaeda/The-Modding-Tree)
I also play games, namely Terraria, ADOFAI, Stardew Valley, and a couple incremental games
